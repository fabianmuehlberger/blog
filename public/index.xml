      <description>Introduction During covid, I used my time renovating the garage and building a woodworking workshop. During winter I noticed that the humidity in the garage was very high. I had to open the windows every day to get the humidity down. I wanted to automate this process and build a dewpoint controller.
The github repository can be found dewpoint-control-upy
For this project I took inspiration from the project presented in the Make Magazine.</description>

      <description>OpenValve OpenValve is a low-cost, open source smart radiator valve that solves these problems. It is based on the ESP32 microcontroller and can be controlled using home assistant or other home automation systems.
The project is available on GitHub
The Problem Smart radiator valves are a great way to save energy and improve your home comfort. However, many smart radiator valves on the market are expensive and closed-source. This means that you can&amp;rsquo;t modify or extend their functionality, and you&amp;rsquo;re locked into the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem.</description>
