## Welcome   

This blog will share my experiences and ideas as I work on this project, as well as other topics related to programming, hardware development.

As a developer and maker, I'm passionate about open-source projects, electronics, and embedded systems. I'm excited to share my latest open-source project and insights as I work on my open-source projects.I'll also be writing about other topics related to these areas, such as programming, hardware development, and Linux. Currently I am working on the openValve, a smart radiator valve for ESPHome. Likewise, I hope to cover my older projects as well as this.

I worked as an event technician for 10+ years, and I loved it. I enjoyed the challenge of solving problems on the fly and working with a team to create something amazing. Likewise, I also gained a lot of experience with electronics and troubleshooting during that time.
A few years ago, I started to study mechatronics/robotics because I was keen to learn more about how things work and how to build them from scratch. 
While studying, I discovered my passion for developing, creating, and being challenged. I love the feeling of accomplishment that comes from building something new and useful and solving complex issues.

I hope you'll find my posts informative and engaging and that you'll learn something new about programming, hardware development, and open source. Your feedback and comments are welcome, so please feel free to share your thoughts on my posts. (once I have fully set up the blog) 

Stay tuned for more updates on my latest open-source project,

Best, 
Fabian
